# EX 39 C program to find sum of digits.
## AIM:
To write a C program to find sum of digits.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Define a variables.
3. Write a program to print the sum and difference of the integers..
4. Read the value using scanf.
5. Ask the user to make an input.
6. Print out the answer.
7. End.
  

## Program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
 int a, b;
 int sum, difference;
 // Input two numbers
 printf("Enter two 
integers: ");
 scanf("%d %d", &a, 
&b);
 // Calculate sum and 
difference
 sum = a + b;
 // Print the results
 printf("Sum = 
%d\n", sum);
 return 0;
}

```

## Output:
